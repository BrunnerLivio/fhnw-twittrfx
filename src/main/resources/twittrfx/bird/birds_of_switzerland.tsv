Black-necked grebe	https://martinfrancois.github.io/bird-images/2560px-eared-grebe-281495239698729.jpg	The black-necked grebe or eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis ) is a member of the grebe family of water birds. It was described in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. There are currently three accepted subspecies, including the nominate subspecies. Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage which extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. When in its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. The subspecies californicus can be distinguished from the nominate by the former's usually longer bill. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, can be differentiated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its smaller size. P. n. gurneyi can also be told apart by its lack of a non-breeding plumage. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.	Unknown	0	0	-	-	-	Europe, North America, Asia, Africa	-	Migrating	-	Unknown	Least concern (LC)	-

It winters along sheltered, ice-free coasts of the north-east Atlantic Ocean and the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. This loon was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It has two subspecies. It was previously considered to be the same species as the Pacific loon, of which it is traditionally considered to be a sister species, although this is debated. In a study that used mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA, the black-throated loon was found to be sister to a clade consisting of the Pacific loon and two sister species, the common loon and the yellow-billed loon.

It is a brood parasite, which means it lays eggs in the nests of other bird species, particularly of dunnocks, Meadow pipits, and Reed warblers. Although its eggs are larger than those of its hosts, the eggs in each type of host nest resemble the host's eggs. The adult too is a mimic, in its case of the sparrowhawk; since that species is a predator, the mimicry gives the female time to lay her eggs without being attacked.	40-74.9 mln	10	0	111 g	32-34 cm	55-60 cm	Europe, Asia, Africa	Carnivore,  Insectivores	Migrating	2-3 weeks	Decreasing	Least concern (LC)	11-13 days

The six subspecies differ clinally, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards the east of the range. All populations are migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.

Northern and eastern populations are migratory, but this species is a permanent resident in the warmer parts of its breeding range. The adult is 23�28�cm (9�11�in) long, and, like other rails, has a body that is flattened laterally, allowing it easier passage through the reed beds it inhabits. It has mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey underparts, black barring on the flanks, long toes, a short tail and a long reddish bill. Immature birds are generally similar in appearance to the adults, but the blue-grey in the plumage is replaced by buff. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails. The former subspecies R.�indicus, has distinctive markings and a call that is very different from the pig-like squeal of the western races, and is now usually split as a separate species, the brown-cheeked rail.

Willow Warbler	https://martinfrancois.github.io/bird-images/shutterstock-1779647555jpg.jpg	The willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus ) is a very common and widespread leaf warbler which breeds throughout northern and temperate Europe and the Palearctic, from Ireland east to the Anadyr River basin in eastern Siberia. It is strongly migratory, with almost all of the population wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.	413-647 mln	5	0	7-15 g	11-12.5 cm	19 cm	Europe, Asia, Africa	Insectivores,  Carnivore	Migrating	-	Decreasing	Least concern (LC)	-
Wood sandpiper	https://martinfrancois.github.io/bird-images/grc3b6nbena-wood-sandpiper-282303761024929.jpg	The wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola ) is a small wader. This Eurasian species is the smallest of the shanks, which are mid-sized long-legged waders of the family Scolopacidae. The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific  glareola is from Latin glarea, "" gravel"".

Woodlark	https://martinfrancois.github.io/bird-images/2560px-mlade-c5a1umske-c5a1eve-28lullula-arborea29-woodlarks2c-juvenile.jpg	The woodlark or wood lark (Lullula arborea ) is the only extant species in the lark genus Lullula. It is found across most of Europe, the Middle East, western Asia and the mountains of north Africa. It is mainly resident (non-migratory) in the west of its range, but eastern populations of this passerine bird are more migratory, moving further south in winter.

Xeme	https://martinfrancois.github.io/bird-images/sabines-gull-larus-sabini-xema-sabini-1.jpg	Sabine's gull ( SAY-bin) (Xema sabini ) also known as the fork-tailed gull or xeme, is a small gull. It is the only species placed in the genus Xema. It breeds in colonies on coasts and tundra, laying two or three spotted olive-brown eggs in a ground nest lined with grass. Sabine's gull is pelagic outside the breeding season. It takes a wide variety of mainly animal food, and will eat any suitable small prey.	over 340,000	18	0	135-225 g	27-33 cm	81-87 cm	North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa	Carnivore,  Insectivores,  Piscivores	Migrating	-	Stable	Least concern (LC)	23-25 days

However, recent DNA studies suggest that the yellow-billed kite differs significantly from black kites in the Eurasian clade, and should be considered as a separate, allopatric species.

Yellow-legged gull	https://martinfrancois.github.io/bird-images/gaivota-ferragudo.jpg	The yellow-legged gull is a large gull found in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, which has only recently achieved wide recognition as a distinct species. It was formerly treated as a subspecies of either the Caspian gull L. cachinnans, or more broadly as a subspecies of the herring gull L. argentatus.The genus name is from Latin Larus which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird, and the species name honours the German zoologist Karl Michahelles.

Zitting cisticola	https://martinfrancois.github.io/bird-images/zitting-cisticola-26-morning-dew-i-img-0489.jpg	The zitting cisticola or streaked fantail warbler (Cisticola juncidis ) is a widely distributed Old World warbler whose breeding range includes southern Europe, Africa (outside the deserts and rainforest), and southern Asia down to northern Australia. A small bird found mainly in grasslands, it is best identified by its rufous rump; as well, it lacks any gold on the collar and the brownish tail is tipped with white. During the breeding season, males have a zigzagging flight display accompanied by regular ""zitting"" calls that have been likened to repeated snips of a scissor. They build their pouch nest suspended within a clump of grass.	Unknown	0	0	-	-	-	Europe, Asia, Africa	-	Not a migrant	-	Increasing	Least concern (LC)	-
